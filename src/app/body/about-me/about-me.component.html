                A well driven, result oriented and self motivated individual who believes in
                aspiring high and then complementing it with hard work.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                I’ve extensive experience with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Angular.
                Combining those with my knowledge of the current web
                standards, I have successfully executed front-end projects
                with cross browser compatibility. Using Twitter Bootstrap and Media query, I
                have also developed responsive websites.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                I have always loved interacting with people, new and old. Front end
                development gives me a chance to do that, not with words, but with code and
                design. Nothing excites me more than the fact that I can potentially reach
                millions of people worldwide and they will be interacting with MY work!
                I’m self-taught. This means I’m independent and need little guidance to get the
                job done. Having said that, I’m never afraid to admit that I don’t know
                something and ask for help. So, if you’re looking for a great developer and a
                future product manager, I’m your man.
